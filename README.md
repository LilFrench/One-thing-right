# One-thing-right
RPG site


This is a school project between three students. We aim to create a motivational site with RPG-like elements. Basically you level-up your
character by completing simple tasks such as : cleaning your room, studying math, doing 40 push-ups, etc. , tasks that you would otherwise
in tedious and boring. By giving you a reward (exp or items) for completing the tasks, you are then slowly getting used to doing them and
would hopefully not require that little extra dopamine from the game/site anymore.


We are still beginner-level programmers, so if you have any questions or remarks, don't hesitate to contact us.
